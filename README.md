Here are all my solutions to problem sets from Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science. 

In it's own words: "Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches you how to solve problems, both with and without code, with an emphasis on correctness, design, and style. Topics include computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and computer science more generally."
